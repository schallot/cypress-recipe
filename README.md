## Developing using Test Kitchen

If you wish to stand up a local copy of this recipe for testing, there is a test kitchen script included in this repository. If you have never installed test kitchen before, then you will need to do so along with downloading a few other tools. Please follow the steps below before running the `kitchen test` command from the directory you have this repository cloned into.

1. Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) ">= 1.5.2"
2. Install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) ">= 4.3.14"
3. Install [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk) ">= 0.2.0"
4. Run `bundle install` in the root of this repository.

Once those steps are completed, you should be able to execute `bundle exec kitchen test` with no problems.
